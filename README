App-Module-Setup

App::Module::Setup is the core module for module-setup, which is a
boilerplate generator for new Perl modules.

Why, yet another one?

All existing boilerplate generators suit many users, but abhor others.
They can do too much, or too little, or use conventions that not
everyone agrees with.

module-setup uses a set of customisable templates so everyone can
tailor it to whatever needs may arise. Its design goal is to be
extremely simple for unexperienced users, while still being useful for
more advanced module writing.
